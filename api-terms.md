This monitoring may include ECAD Labs accessing your API Client, for example, to identify security issues that could affect ECAD Labs or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring.

Our APIs frequently transmit third-party content (such as compiled code, encrypted data, distributed ledger and indexer data, text, software, images and other media). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms. We may remove or refuse to provide access to APIs where we have grounds to believe that content contravenes our policies, [Terms](https://www.ecadlabs.com/tos) or API Terms. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are authorized to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the APIs may be restricted, limited, or filtered under applicable law, regulation, and policy. However, we have no obligation to do so.

**Short version:** *You grant us a limited, non-exclusive and royalty-free license to handle the content you submit through the APIs.*

Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. ECAD Labs does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling ECAD Labs to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and following he applicable ECAD Labs privacy policies, you give ECAD a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish the content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.

### c. Retrieval of content
**Short version:** *You must have user permission to expose non-public content through our APIs.*

When a user's non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.

**Short version:** *You must support data portability that allows your users to export their data.*

ECAD Labs supports data portability. For as long as you use or store any user data that you obtained through the APIs, you agree to enable your users to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from similar products and services, subject to applicable laws. You agree that you will not make that data available to third parties who do not also abide by this obligation.

### e. Prohibitions on Content
Unless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not allow your end-users or others acting on your behalf to, do the following with content returned from the APIs:

1. Scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;
2. Copy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display, or sublicense to any third party;
3. Misrepresent the source or ownership; or
4. Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of the material.

### f. Your Obligations Post-Termination
**Short version:** *You must delete cached and stored content obtained through an API upon termination or discontinuance of your access.*

Upon any termination of the API Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API and delete any cached or stored content.
